# Arabic-handwritten-OCR

This project focuses on developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for recognizing **handwritten Arabic text**. Due to the unique nature of Arabic script—its cursive form, contextual character shapes, and writing variability—this task presents a significant challenge in the field of OCR and Natural Language Processing.

We explore and integrate multiple deep learning models, including:

* Transfer Learning with **ResNet50V2**
* Traditional OCR using **Pytesseract**
* Custom CNN-based approaches


## Goals

* Recognize handwritten Arabic characters and words
* Compare traditional OCR techniques with deep learning-based approaches
* Evaluate performance using different preprocessing and augmentation strategies
