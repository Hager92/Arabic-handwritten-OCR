Arabic-handwritten-OCR
This project focuses on developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for handwritten Arabic text. Recognizing Arabic handwriting is a challenging task due to the scriptâ€™s cursive nature, contextual character shapes, and variability in individual handwriting styles.

We explore and compare various OCR approaches:

Tesseract-based OCR

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Transfer Learning with ResNet50V2

Transformer-based OCR (TrOCR)
