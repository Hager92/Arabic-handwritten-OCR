# Arabic-handwritten-OCR

This project focuses on developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for handwritten Arabic text. Recognizing Arabic handwriting presents unique challenges due to the scriptâ€™s cursive nature, positional character variations, and high variability in writing styles. Our work explores a combination of classical and deep learning-based methods to address these issues.

## Project Overview

We implemented and compared various techniques for Arabic handwritten OCR, including:

* Traditional OCR using Tesseract
* Deep learning approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Transfer learning with ResNet50V2
* Segmentation methods for improved recognition accuracy
* Transformer-based OCR using TrOCR

## Objectives

* Build a reliable system for recognizing handwritten Arabic text
* Evaluate and compare the performance of different OCR approaches
* Investigate the impact of segmentation techniques on recognition accuracy
